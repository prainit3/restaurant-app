# RestaurantApp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 11.2.12.

## Application Design/Flow

As a user, you would be able to enter a postcode in the form field, search, and have a populated list of valid restaruants appear below. You would then be able to sort and filter the results by their various properties.

## Unfinished Content

I was unable to build the app so that it could properly get the data from the api. The logic is set up for it to do so, and I have added comments where items are missing.
